I am a Ph.D. in economics. I am a decision theorist and experimental economist working on the modeling and the understanding of human behavior. 
I design experiments and use revealed preference techniques to study various assumptions on individual preferences and utility.

I am currently working as maître de conférence (assistant professor) at the University Paris 8.
