We report the results of an experiment in which subjects vote on a procedure to allocate a reward to half of them. The first possibility is an explicitly random device: the result of a lottery. The second is either an unpredictable procedure they could interpret as meritocratic, or one that is obviously arbitrary. We run all treatments with and without control. We identify an aversion to lotteries and clearly arbitrary procedures across treatments, even though, on aggregate, subjects do not believe any procedure to give them a higher probability of success and there is no correlation between beliefs and outcomes. In line with the literature, we also find evidence of a control premium in most procedures.","tags":["Mechanism Design","Lottery"],"title":"Rituals of Reason: A Choice-Based Approach to the Acceptability of Lotteries in Allocation Problems","type":"event"},{"authors":["Elias Bouacida","Renaud Foucart"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1647993600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647993600,"objectID":"56fc393821690cbe0145d76eac26c6d2","permalink":"https://www.bouacida.fr/publication/social-acceptability-lottery/","publishdate":"2021-10-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/social-acceptability-lottery/","section":"publication","summary":"Rituals of Reason: A Choice-Based Approach to the Acceptability of Lotteries in Allocation Problems","tags":["Lotteries","Mechanism Design"],"title":"Rituals of Reason: A Choice-Based Approach to the Acceptability of Lotteries in Allocation Problems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elias Bouacida"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1623933000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623933000,"objectID":"0775d4c0613763279d6bf18647d350c0","permalink":"https://www.bouacida.fr/talk/identifying-choice-correspondences/","publishdate":"2021-05-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/identifying-choice-correspondences/","section":"event","summary":"We introduce a general method for identifying the *sets* of best alternatives of decision makers in each choice sets, i.e., their *choice correspondences*, experimentally. In contrast, most experiments force the choice of a *single* alternative in each choice set. The method allow decision makers to choose several alternatives, provide a small incentive for each alternative chosen, and then randomly select one for payment. We derive two conditions under which the method may recover the choice correspondence. First, when the incentive to choose several alternative becomes small. Second, we can at least partially identifies the choice correspondence, by obtaining supersets and subsets for each choice set. We illustrate the method with an experiment, in which subjects choose between four paid tasks. In the latter case, we can retrieve the full choice correspondence for 18% of subjects and bind it for another 40%. Using the limit result, we show that 40% of all observed choices can be rationalized by complete, reflexive and transitive preferences in the experiment, i.e., satisfy the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preferences – WARP hereafter. Weakening the classical model, incomplete preferences or just-noticeable difference preferences do not rationalize more choice correspondences. Going beyond, however, we show that complete, reflexive and transitive preferences with menu-dependent choices rationalize 96% of observed choices. Having elicited choice correspondences allows to conclude that indifference is widespread in the experiment.These results pave the way for exploring various behavioral models with a unified method.","tags":["Choice correspondence","Revealed Preferences"],"title":"Identifying Choice Correspondences","type":"event"},{"authors":["Elias Bouacida"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1622729700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622729700,"objectID":"6cb1ad559947d9bfa28a93dd96a4212d","permalink":"https://www.bouacida.fr/talk/the-acceptability-of-lotteries-in-allocation-problems-a-choice-based-approach/","publishdate":"2021-05-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/the-acceptability-of-lotteries-in-allocation-problems-a-choice-based-approach/","section":"event","summary":"We report the results of two experiments on the social acceptability of random devices in allocation mechanisms.

In this work, we provide the first empirical application of a leading proposal for welfare analysis in the presence of behavioral biases, presented in Bernheim and Rangel (2009), called the Strict Unambiguous Choice  Relation (hereafter Strict UCR).  However, there are two potential problems in the application of this approach: Strict UCR can be cyclic on consumption data, which are incomplete, and Strict UCR is very conservative, which may make it overly coarse, and thus, useless (Rubinstein and Salant 2012). We address these concerns using a dataset of package grocery purchases by 397 households over a two years period in the United States. We find that the Strict UCR relation is cyclic on incomplete data, but much less than revealed preferences (8% against 99% of agents exhibit cycles). It is also almost complete, as in our application, almost all bundles are comparable. In addition, we introduced two new relations based on the idea of the Strict UCR, but that guarantee acyclicity. One is shown to be equivalenton complete data, and the other is in the same flavor than Strict UCR, but is more conservative.","tags":["Behavioral Economics","Economic Welfare","Strong Axiom of Revealed Preferences","Scanner Data"],"title":"Predictive Power in Behavioral Welfare Economics","type":"event"},{"authors":["Elias Bouacida","Daniel Martin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1435050000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1435050000,"objectID":"683183ace2114030596cf559e44bcaf2","permalink":"https://www.bouacida.fr/talk/predictive-power-in-behavioral-welfare-economics/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/predictive-power-in-behavioral-welfare-economics/","section":"event","summary":"Revealed preferences are a potentially powerful tool for conducting welfare analyses, but due to forces such as behavioral biases, 'irrational behaviors' such as non-transitivity (i.e., cycles of preferences) can appear in revealed preferences, which render them useless for welfare purposes.
